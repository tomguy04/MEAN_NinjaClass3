<!-- 
Part I
Recreate the base Ninja class from scratch using ES6 classes. 
Your Ninja needs the following attributes:

    name
    health
    speed
    strength

Speed and strength should be 3 by default. 
Health should be 100 by default. Do not worry about private variables.

The Ninja class should have the following methods:

    sayName() - This should log that Ninja's name to the console.
    showStats() - This should show the Ninja's Strength and Speed, as well as their health.
    drinkSake() - This should add +10 Health to the Ninja

Part II - Sensei Class
Extend the Ninja class and create the Sensei class. 
A Sensei should have 200 Health, 10 speed, and 10 strength by default. 
In addition, a Sensei should have a new attribute called wisdom, and the default should be 10. 
Finally, add the speakWisdom() method. speakWisdom() should call the drinkSake() method 
from the Ninja class, before console.logging a wise message.
